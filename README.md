# Task Management App : ToDo List App

## Why?


In the midst of busy modern life, developer Shreya took on the challenge of simplifying daily routines. Recognizing the chaos of managing tasks and deadlines, she set out to create the ToDo List Appâ€”a user-friendly tool for efficient task management. The app, hosted on Heroku with secure data storage on AWS-based MongoDB Atlas, empowers users to stay organized and productive. Today, it stands as a symbol of her commitment to simplifying lives, one task at a time.This ToDo List App was created with the goal of providing a simple yet effective tool for managing daily tasks. As a user, you can easily create, edit, and delete tasks to stay organized and productive. The app's responsive design ensures that you can access your tasks from any device, whether it's your computer, tablet, or smartphone.

## Overview

The ToDo List App is a dynamic web application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It allows users to create, update, and track tasks, making it a valuable tool for personal task management. The app is built using a combination of frontend and backend technologies and utilizes MongoDB for data storage.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML
  - Custom CSS
  - JavaScript
  - EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for templating

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB via Mongoose (ODM)

- **Deployment and Hosting**:
  - Hosted on Heroku
  - MongoDB hosted on AWS cluster via MongoDB Atlas
  - 
## Challenegs faced and their solution
 
- 1. Database Connection Issues

  Challenge: Connecting to MongoDB Atlas - connection error message.
  
  Solution: Ensure that the IP allowlist in your MongoDB Atlas cluster allows connections from your network. Double-check credentials and authentication settings. Consider whitelisting the IP address or range.

- 2. Responsive Design

Challenge: Designing a responsive user interface that adapts to different screen sizes can be complex.

Solution: Utilize CSS media queries to create responsive layouts, ensuring elements adjust appropriately on various devices. Test the app on different screen sizes to refine the design.

- 3. Handling User Input

Challenge: Managing user input and interactions, such as adding, editing, and deleting tasks, can be intricate.

Solution: Implement robust form handling and validation in your app. Use Express.js to process user input securely. Handle database updates and deletions carefully to avoid data corruption.

## Code History

To understand how the app was built from scratch and explore different versions, follow these steps:

1. Click on the "Commits" tab in the GitHub repository.
2. Select a specific commit representing a version (e.g., "Version 1 - Initial Setup").
3. Click "Browse Files" to view the code changes for that version.

This commit history provides insights into the app's development process.


## Code History steps: 

To download a specific version of your project using the command line (CMD or terminal), you can use the Git command-line tool. Here are the steps to download a specific version of your project:

1. **Open a Terminal/Command Prompt**: Open your terminal or command prompt on your computer.

2. **Navigate to Your Project's Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your project is stored. For example:

   ```
   cd path/to/your/todolist-app
   ```

   Replace `path/to/your/todolist-app` with the actual path to your project directory.

3. **List Available Versions**: To see a list of available versions (commits), you can use the `git log` command. This will display a list of commits along with their unique commit IDs (hashes) and commit messages.

   ```
   git log
   ```

   You'll see something like this:

   ```
   commit 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678 (HEAD -> master)
   Author: Your Name <youremail@example.com>
   Date:   Mon Sep 20 12:34:56 2023 +0200

       Version 1.0 - Initial Setup

   commit abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12
   Author: Your Name <youremail@example.com>
   Date:   Tue Sep 21 09:00:00 2023 +0200

       Version 1.1 - Templating Engine Integration

   # ... (more commits)
   ```

4. **Checkout the Desired Version**: To download a specific version, use the `git checkout` command followed by the commit ID of the version you want. For example, to download "Version 1.0 - Initial Setup," you would use the commit ID associated with that version:

   ```
   git checkout 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
   ```

   Replace `1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678` with the actual commit ID you want to download.

5. **Explore the Downloaded Version**: Once you've checked out the specific version, your project files will be updated to reflect the state of that version. You can now explore the code and files for that particular version on your local system.

6. **Return to the Latest Version (Optional)**: If you want to return to the latest version (the `master` branch), you can use the `git checkout` command without specifying a commit ID:

   ```
   git checkout master
   ```

   This will bring you back to the latest version of your project.

Please note that when you check out a specific version, you'll be in a "detached HEAD" state, which means you can view and work with the code, but changes won't be saved to the version history. If you want to make changes based on a specific version, it's recommended to create a new branch from that version using `git checkout -b new-branch-name`.
